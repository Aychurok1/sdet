What are variables?
   When we have to make a computer do something for us, we have to provide the computer
   with instructions and data. To store this data we need something that can help us store and
   retrieve this information when we need it. Variables help us store this data.
   There are 8 basic types of variables in java. These are called primitive data types.
   1) byte 2) short 3) int 4) long 5) float 6) double 7) char 8) boolean
Data types to store simple numbers:
    When ever we have whole numbers the numbers  without the decimal parts like
    10,50,10000,666,8888888885,-4585,-45 we use the below data types
    byte, short, int , long but as a tester 99% of the time we will be using int
    data type to store whole numbers.


Data types to store floating point Number/decimal numbers:
    Whenever we have to store floating point numbers like 10.5, 2.3 -5.6,0.0001 etc.
    we use below data types.
    1)float 2) double
    99% of the time double is used and that's what we as a tester will be using

Note:
    All the primitive data types start with lowercase letters like byte,short,int
    long, float, double, char, boolean.
DataType:
    is a mechanism that helps computer to store specific type of information and
    also helps it to perform calculation on that information
